# Python Projects: JSON and API Examples
## Overview
This repository contains three standalone Python files, each demonstrating practical uses of JSON handling, API interaction, and data persistence.

Use the menu options to:
View books.
Add a new book.
Save and exit.
**Requirements**
Python 3.8+
tabulate library (install via pip install tabulate).

2. Cat Facts Fetcher (Task2.py)
Fetches a random cat fact from the Cat Facts API, saves it to a JSON file, and reads it back.

**Features**
Fetches a random fact about cats.
Saves the fact to catFacts.json.
Reads and displays the fact from the file.
How to Run

python Task2.py
The script will:
Fetch a fact from the API.
Save it to a JSON file.
Read it back and display it.
**Requirements**
Python 3.8+
requests library (install via pip install requests).

3. JSON Conversion Demo (Task3.py)
Demonstrates JSON serialization and deserialization by converting a Python dictionary to a JSON string and back.

**Features**
Converts a sample dictionary to a JSON-formatted string.
Converts the JSON string back to a Python dictionary.
Prints both results.
How to Run
Run the script:
